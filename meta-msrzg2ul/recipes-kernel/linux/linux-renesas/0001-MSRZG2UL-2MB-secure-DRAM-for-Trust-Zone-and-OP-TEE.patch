Subject: [PATCH] MSRZG2UL: 2MB secure DRAM for Trust Zone and OP-TEE

In order to use Trust Zone and OP-TEE in your system, the secure area
must be hidden from Linux. By default, the BSP allocates 128MB of
space at the beginning of DDR Memory. For further information see
https://confluence.renesas.com/display/REN/RZ+BSP+Porting+-+Memory+Map.

We reduce the space to 2MB, which is the minimum. It's also necessary
to update the memory node in the device-tree of U-Boot and Linux.
